### TODO

- Invoke States Inline
- Pin GoRoutines To States
- Create [Benchmark Comparison](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/go-node.html)
- Look into using Dynamic Select Statement reflect.SelectCase vs GoSelect
- Observer For The Worker Pool To Record Statistics On States/Edges
- Detect & Fail On Edge Cycle Within Manager
- Unit Test Coverage
